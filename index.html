                    They’re incredibly effective
                </h2>

                <p>
                    There’s no denying the power of video marketing. In fact, including a video on a landing page can increase conversions by 80%. And when it comes to explainer videos specifically, one study found that they were able to increase conversion rates by 20% on average.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what exactly is an explainer video?
                </p>
                <p>
                    An explainer video is a short, animated video that explains your business, product, or service in a simple and easy-to-understand way. These videos are usually no more than 2 minutes long, and they’re designed to grab your attention and hold it until the very end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best explainer videos are also engaging and entertaining, which is why they’re an effective marketing tool. After all, people are far more likely to watch a<a href="https://spinachvideo.com/boost-your-business-how-explainer-videos-can-boost-your-business/">video</a>than to read a long-form article or even a blog post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re thinking about creating an explainer video for your business, there are a few things you’ll need to keep in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This post will share everything you need to know about creating an explainer video that converts.
                </p>
                <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>
                        Keep It Short and Sweet
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to explainer videos, less is more. The best explainer videos are usually no more than 2 minutes long. Any longer than that, and you run the risk of losing your viewer’s attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might be tempted to include as much information as possible in your explainer video, but resist the urge. The goal of an explainer video is not to provide a comprehensive overview of your business, product, or service. Instead, it’s to give your viewer a quick and easy way to understand what you do and how it can benefit them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you try to pack too much information into your explainer video, you’ll only end up confusing your viewers and losing their attention. So keep it short, sweet, and to the point.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Use Simple Language
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        When creating an explainer video, everyone must use language that everyone can understand. After all, not everyone is an expert in your industry or field. This means using jargon-free language and avoiding technical terms whenever possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should also avoid using industry-specific acronyms or abbreviations. Even if your viewer does happen to be an expert in your field, they might not be familiar with the acronyms or abbreviations you use. So it’s always best to avoid caution and use language everyone can understand.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Tell a Story
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        One of the best ways to engage your viewers and keep their attention is to tell a story. Humans are hardwired for stories, which is why they’re such an effective marketing tool. When you say to an account, you’re more likely to connect with your viewer on an emotional level, which can make them more receptive to your message.

                            People love sharing videos, and that’s good news for your business. People who watch your explainer video and enjoy it will likely share it with their friends and followers. 92% of mobile video viewers share videos with others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This word-of-mouth marketing is precious because it helps you reach a larger audience without spending any money on advertising. And when people see that their friends and trusted sources are sharing your video, they’re more likely to watch it themselves.

                        <p>
                            Since Google owns YouTube, it’s no surprise that videos are given preferential treatment in search results. In fact, including a video on your website can help you rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Google loves videos because they’re engaging and informative. By including a video on your website, you’re more likely to keep visitors on your site longer, which signals to Google that your site is valuable and worth ranking higher.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to helping you rank higher in search results, videos can also help you generate more leads and conversions. Videos are highly shareable, so they can help promote your brand and increase awareness of your products or services.

                    If you’re not already using videos on your website, now is the time to start. Here are a few tips to get you started:

                <br>
                <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>
                        Optimize your videos for SEO
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Like your website, your videos need to be optimized for search engine optimization (SEO). This means including relevant keywords in your video title and description.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also use transcripts or captions to make your videos more accessible to a broader audience. Including transcripts or captions also allows you to include more keywords, which can help your videos rank higher in search results.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Make sure your videos are mobile-friendly
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Since more and more people are watching videos on their mobile devices, making sure your videos are optimized for mobile viewing is essential. This means using a responsive video player that can adjust to different screen sizes.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Use an engaging thumbnail image
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Your thumbnail image is what appears in search results, so make sure it’s engaging and attractive. Include a call to action, such as “Watch Now” or “Learn More,” to encourage viewers to click on your video.

                    It’s no secret that people have short attention spans these days. But even with that being the case, studies have shown that people are likelier to remember information presented in a video format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is because our brains are wired to process information more effectively when presented in a way that engages multiple senses. And since videos engage our visual and auditory senses, they’re a potent tool for getting your message across.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not to mention, videos are also highly shareable, which means they have the potential to reach a much wider audience than other types of content.
